      <h2 id="toc_0">Negative Feedback</h2>

<p>A little while ago we released this comic in which we used the word fat
and we had one complaint that it was offensive.</p>

<p><img src="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/299542_493943143989770_1084414739_n.png" alt="Big &amp; Tall"></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">The Defense Takes the Stand</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree that a person would feel offended.
People are offended by lots of things.</p>

<p>However, I want to put forth a case as to why it was appropriate
(and perhaps necessary) to use the word fat in all of its glory.</p>

<p>(read through to the end before getting in a huff,
there&#39;s some legitimate reasoning here)</p>

<p>America has a lot of overweight people
(overweight is so much longer of a word than fat).
Although some people claim that obesity
(a word which implies not just an image issue, but also a medical condition)
is heriditary and yada yada.
I&#39;ll argue <em>FALSE</em>.
False in the sense that weight gain or loss is more strongly
associated with calorie intake than any other factor.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> people are <strong>big-boned</strong>.
<em>Some</em> people have <strong>slower metabolisms</strong>.
<em>All</em> people gain weight if their calorie intake is higher than what they burn.
Obesity isn&#39;t a <em>world problem</em> like a viral infection or birth defect.
It&#39;s a <em>first-world problem</em>.</p>

<p>My point is that you can take reasonable measures to adjust your weight
to be what you desire.
Two friends of mine have lost 50+ pounds in the past year.
The didn&#39;t like their image and they changed it.
Hurrah for my friends!
:-D</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">A Tangent</h3>

<p>Shorter people can also wear high heels, boots - or even have
surgery to become taller.
Tall people can&#39;t wear something to become shorter
(and I&#39;ve never heard of surgeries to make one shorter either).</p>

<p>Excessive shortness is considered a handicap and in order to make things
more <em>accessible</em> to the handicapped (and children) many things are built
<em>way</em> too close to the ground.</p>

<p>Yet excessive height isn&#39;t considered a handicap and we&#39;re supposed to just
deal with it.</p>

<p><strong>What about our accessibility?</strong> Are we lesser people because we&#39;re tall?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Think of the Children!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, I can agree with that.
100% of people go through a short phase.
Only about 10% of people go through a tall <del>phase</del>.
That&#39;s fair. </p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Back on track</h3>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t make sense as to why words like <em>fat</em> should be taboo.
There are many other terms that apply to people who are making lifestyle
choices that negatively affect their image which are not considered taboo.</p>

<p>As an example, it&#39;s not considered culturally insensitive to inspecifically
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MethProject">address a group of drug addicts</a>.</p>

<p>But whatever, the truth is that <em>fat</em> is often considered an offensive word.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">We&#39;ve got hurt feelings</h3>

<p>Having established that <em>fat</em> is often taboo,
now it&#39;s time to explain why we
(the tall community)
<a href="http://youtu.be/9zI3_pnUU3k">are crying tears of a rapper</a>.</p>

<p>Tall people complain about not being able to find clothes that fit.
Non-tall people invariably chip in with their advice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you tried big and tall?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the phrase &quot;Big &amp; Tall&quot; is a lie -
whether referring to the official JC Penney trademark or any of the
assortment of various stores with a similar claim.</p>

<p>These stores use <em>Tall</em> as part of their euphemism to attract <em>big</em> people
without offending them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basic marketing psychology.
The idea is that the subconscious thought and feeling of a potential customer
will go something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I go to the Big store then I&#39;m fat, which is <em>taboo</em>.
But if I go to the Big and Tall
store then maybe I&#39;m Big, or maybe I&#39;m Tall  -
and Tall is <em>good</em> so I can
<em>brag</em> that I shop at a big <em>and tall</em> store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality big and tall stores don&#39;t have lengths that are any longer than
would be expected in accordance with normal size progression.</p>

<p>Well, we&#39;re born this way.
It&#39;s not something we can change by changing our lifestyle.
It&#39;s not that we have anything against the fat,
it&#39;s that we don&#39;t like that this double-euphemism <strong>comes at the <em>our</em> expense</strong>!</p>

<p>An <em>extra large</em> is maybe 2 inches longer than a <em>small</em>.
For many brands and styles, an <em>LT</em> and an <em>XXXL</em> (pronounced triple-X L)
are exactly the same size - they&#39;re simply relabeled.</p>

<p>We (speaking for many a tall person) are a little bitter about that.
There&#39;s some hurt feelings.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all had the experience of thinking we&#39;ve found something that will fit well,
only to find out that <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20cake%20is%20a%20lie">the cake is a lie</a>.
That breeds some resentment - again not towards the fat,
more towards the companies that use us to their advantage without giving us
the promise product in return.</p>

<p>(That said, it&#39;s worth noting that all though a MT from the regular section
<em>might</em> be legitimately Medium Tall -
but it&#39;s <em>extremely</em> rare to find one -
whereas an MT from a big and tall section is almost always a XXL or XXXL relabeled)</p>

<p>That&#39;s the underlying psyschology of why we (Men&#39;s Medium Tall)
chose to use the word <em>fat</em>.
If we just said <em>big</em>,
then we would fit into the stereotype of protecting group A at the expense of group B.</p>

<p>Well, we&#39;re group Tall and at this stage in the game we need the Tall to know
that we&#39;re on <em>their</em> side.
Not the side of the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/overwt.htm">69.2%</a>.
Not the politically correct side.
Not the side of the <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/325064.html">95%</a>.</p>

<p><strong>On the side of the top 10%.</strong></p>

<p>P.S. In that 10% we&#39;re al actually includes people who have long torsos</p>
