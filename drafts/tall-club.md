*Tall Club* is kinda like *The Game*, but in reverse.
With *The Game*, you're losing if you're distracted by it.
With *Tall Club*, you're in it if you know you're in it -
and if there's any confusion or hesitation as to what it is,
you're obviously not in it.

I'd say that some guys know as early as 6'0" that they're in *Tall Club*
(and I'd wager that being early on, it's probably more that the girls are letting
them know and the get it).

Likewise some women know as early as 5'8".

In any case:
If you know, you know (and you are).
If you don't, you don't (and you aren't).

I would definitely say that almost every guy knows
he's in *Tall Club* if by the time he's reached 6'2.5",
wheras a lot of guys between 6'1 and 6'2" aren't in the club
simply because they don't know.

Women are a bit different.
A woman who reaches 5'11" doesn't get instant access -
she has a right of passage.
From what I gather that right of passage is the date with 3-inch heels (or more)
and feels completely her flavor of feminine with the man who is standing strong
and confident beside her (and most usually several inches above her).
Until that point it seems like the ladies know the club exists,
but just can't quite join.

Anyway, when you're in *the club* you know that you're in and you get the jokes,
the references, etc.

Not to say that the people in outside don't *understand* per se,
but rather they don't *get it*.
It's not who they are, yet.

It's like engineer humor.
Engineers think it's hilarious - because it is.
Whereas non-engineers understand the humor and it's funny, I guess -
but nothing to put out a code red ROFLcopter amber alert out about.

For us, right now,
we're really just targeting people in *the club*.

We're not trying to convince people that they look about as much out of place
as a bowl-cut kid out of the 1990's in a 2010's high-school (or college)
when they wear stuff that doesn't fit.

Neither are we trying to convince people that our tall jokes are the best thing
since lollerskates.

What we're doing is enlisting the mavericks and opinion leaders -
the ones who already know they're in *the club*,
who know what's funny and what's cool,
who know the other people in *the club*,
who know who needs to be in *the club*
and who - quite frankly -
have already been trying to find us when we didn't exist and then gave up hope
because all of the googles are full of broken promises
(much like Android) about clothing stores that nearly deliver and then don't.

Whether you're in the club or not
you still deserve to dress well and look great,
but we're not going to force you in.
The door is open and you can join at your leisure.

P.S. If you know you're in the club, expect an invite soon.
